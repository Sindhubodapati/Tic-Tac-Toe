# ❌⭕ Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Two players take turns playing as "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The first to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins!


## 🎮 Features

- Player vs Player gameplay
- Visual win message and celebration
- Reset and New Game functionality
- Fully responsive layout with modern styling
- Draw detection with message display


## 📂 Project Structure
```
Tic-Tac-Toe/
├── index.html  # Main HTML structure
├── style.css  # Styling for game layout
└── app.js   # Game logic and interactivity
```



## 🧠 How It Works

- The game starts with player **O**.
- Players click on empty boxes to place their mark.
- The script checks for win conditions after each turn.
- When a player wins, a message is displayed and further moves are disabled.
- If all boxes are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
- Use **"Reset Game"** or **"New Game"** to restart.
